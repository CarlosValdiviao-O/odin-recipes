    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to freid fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
